# ❄️ Nordix System Settings

A graphical settings system for the Nordix Desktop Environment built on Hyprland. Provides a unified interface to configure the desktop without editing config files manually.

## Overview

Nordix System Settings is a collection of GTK4/Libadwaita settings modules accessed through a central launcher. Each module reads and writes directly to the corresponding Hyprland configuration file, with changes applied immediately via hyprctl reload.

The launcher hides while a settings module is open and reappears when it is closed.

## Architecture

nordix-system-settings.py is the central launcher that starts each module as an independent process. Each module is a standalone GTK4/Libadwaita application with its own application ID, allowing them to run in isolation without interfering with each other.

## How it works

1. Each settings module parses its corresponding Hyprland config file on startup
2. The user adjusts settings through the GUI
3. On Apply, the module writes the updated config and runs hyprctl reload
4. A backup of the previous config is created automatically before each save

## Config locations

All Nordix Desktop configuration files are stored in:

    ~/.config/nordix/desktop/config/

This keeps Nordix settings separate from any manual Hyprland configuration. The main Hyprland config sources these files.

## Windowrules.conf - animations.conf - keybind.conf - color.conf
These are part of Yggdrasil's foundation and are not handled in the System Settings GUI, that would be unsustainable. They are however very well documented, so anyone can change them if they wish. 

Read more about them here:

- [**Nordix Windorules**](/windowrules/README-windowrules.md)
- [**Nordix Keybinds**]
- [**Nordix Animations**]
- [**color**]

## Requirements

- Hyprland
- Python 3
- GTK4
- Libadwaita

## Part of Nordix desktop envirorment **Yggdrasil**

- All of the Nordix settings GUI is components of the Nordix Desktop Environment Yggdrasil, an Arch Linux based desktop built on Hyprland with ZFS as the root filesystem. The system is designed to provide a complete desktop experience with graphical configuration tools while maintaining the power and flexibility of a tiling Wayland compositor.
